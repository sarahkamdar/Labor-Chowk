# Labor-Chowk
The Labour Chowk System is a digital platform designed to address critical issues faced by daily wage laborers and employers. It aims to provide greater visibility, efficiency, transparency, and fairness within the labor market by connecting daily wage laborers with potential employers, digitizing the traditional labor market, and ensuring better working conditions and fair wages.

Key Objectives:

  * Empower Laborers: Provide laborers with easy access to job opportunities, visibility of their skills, and transparent hiring processes.

  * Connect Employers and Laborers: Bridge the gap between employers seeking skilled or unskilled labor and laborers searching for work.

  * Ensure Fair Wages: Guarantee that laborers are paid fair wages for their work, reducing exploitation and underpayment.

Features:

  * Digital Profiles for Laborers: Laborers can create profiles, highlighting their skills, experience, and availability. Employers can easily browse and hire based on skillset.

  * Job Posting and Search: Employers can post job listings with clear descriptions, wages, and location, while laborers can search for jobs that match their skills and preferences.

  * Rating and Review System: After job completion, both laborers and employers can rate and review each other to promote accountability, trust, and transparency.
